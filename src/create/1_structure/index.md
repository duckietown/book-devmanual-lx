# Step 1: Review the LX Structure

A learning experience is structured in three parts, each implemented by a different directory. 
These directories are created for you when running the command `dts lx create` (more on this in the following
sections of this manual). When distributed, they will reside in three different Git repositories.

If you are reading this as a learner, you will only need to use the single LX directory provided to you
by your instructor or class instructions. All the necessary behind the scenes components to drive the LX 
activities will be handled automatically by `dts`.

## Three parts make a single LX

A Learning Experience (LX) is broken down into three parts:

- A _learner's workspace_;
- A _back-end_;
- A _solution_;


### The _learner's workspace_

The _learner's workspace_ (also referred to as `the meat`) is the only part that a learner will ever need to 
interact with. It contains instructions, interactive learning materials (e.g., jupyter notebooks) and 
boilerplate code that the learner will have to work on, complete, and in some cases submit.


### The _back-end_

The _back-end_ (also referred to as `the recipe`) is what defines the rules of a learning experience.
It contains all those files that are necessary for the _learner's workspace_ to function but must be protected 
from the learner's edits. The `recipe` constitues the immutable part of a learning experience, 
and it is shared by all the learners' workspaces and solutions of said LX;

**For example,** in a robot localization exercise, the back-end might have access to a map of the environment 
and a trajectory taken by a robot within it. The back-end would use this data to generate simulated sensors' 
readings and pass those on to the _learner's workspace_. The learner is required to implement a system that can
consume these readings and reconstruct the original trajectory taken by the robot. In this case, the back-end
must protect the ground-truth trajectory of the robot or else the solution would be exposed to the learner,
effectively invalidating the usefulness of any grading.


### The _solution_

The _solution_ part is simply a copy of the _learner's workspace_ but with all the solutions to the
activities and exercises already implemented. This is usually used for two main reasons: (i) to make
sure that the boilerplate provided in the _learner's workspace_ is enough for a learner to implement
a correct solution to the problems presented; (ii) to serve as example solutions to problems that are
optional or not graded;

```{tip}
The reason why the **back-end** the **learner's workspace** are also respectively referred to as 
**the recipe** and **the meat** comes from an analogy with a cooking scenario. 
The back-end defines the rules, so it is a **recipe** for
how the learning experience works, the learner brings the content, the solution, the substance, hence the
**meat** that together with the recipe makes a cooked meal, in this case a solved learning experience.
Morevoer, similarly to how better cuts of meat lead to better tasting meals, better solutions lead to
better scores for the learner. Solving a learning experience just became a hunt for the best meat.

(sec:lx-development-workspace)=
## Development Workspace

An LX development workspace is set up on running `dts lx create`.  This command generates a workspace directory that is named using a filesafe version of the LX name. {numref}`fig:lx-development-tree` shows an example of how
an LX development workspace is structured.

```{figure} ../../_images/create/dev-tree.png
:name: fig:lx-development-tree

Directory structure of a LX development project named `How To Robot!` generated by `dts lx create`.
```

### The learner's workspace (the meat)

The _learner's workspace_ is stored inside the directory `lx` 
(`how-to-robot/lx` in {numref}`fig:lx-development-tree`). {numref}`fig:lx-template-tree` shows an example of what
a learner's workspace looks like.

```{figure} ../../_images/create/lx-template-tree.png
:name: fig:lx-template-tree

Directory structure of the LX template generated by `dts lx create`.
```

### The back-end (the recipe)

The _back-end_ is stored inside the directory `recipe`
(`how-to-robot/recipe` in {numref}`fig:lx-development-tree`). {numref}`fig:recipe-template-tree` shows an example of what
a back-end directory looks like.

```{figure} ../../_images/create/recipe-template-tree.png
:name: fig:recipe-template-tree

Directory structure of the LX recipe template generated by `dts lx create`.
```

### The solution

When a new LX is created, the _learner's workspace_ and the _solution_ located in the `solution` directory are identical. The instructor is
then responsible for adding a fully developed and tested solution, with example agents and activity solutions. 

```{tip}
While developing a new LX, it is good practice to start working on the solution first. Once the solution is
in place, parts of the solution with relative pedagogical value can be stripped out and replaced with 
placeholders effectively producing a boilerplate code that can populate the learner's workspace. 
This procedure guarantees that the resulting boilerplate is (by construction) enough for the learner to
achieve a valid solution.
