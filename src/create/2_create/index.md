# Step 2: Create a New LX

New learning experiences are developed within the [](sec:lx-development-workspace).
This structure provides a working directory containing all three of the required directories 
- `lx`, `recipe`, and `solution` - for your LX in one place.


## What do I need to know ahead of time?

Some information will be required to initialize your LX:

```{list-table} Development LX requirements
:header-rows: 1
:name: create-table

* - Information
  - Description
* - Title
  - This is a human readable name that will also be converted into a safe file format to name your LX 
  directories. For example, `How to Robot!` is used as the title and then converted to `how-to-robot` in file and 
  directory names.
* - Description
  - This should contain a learning goal for the LX and short summary of what students will accomplish.
* - Dependencies
  - The `dts lx create` interface allows you to list initial `apt` and `python3` dependencies so that 
  you can ensure your base build works prior to development.
```

```{note}
You can always go back and change these values within the 
appropriate project files later, but beginning your work with a title, learning goal, and list of general 
dependencies will help focus your activity development.
```

## Creating an LX development project

Create your LX development project by running

    dts lx create   

Wait for the form UI to appear or click on the URL provided in the terminal to access the following form:

```{figure} ../../_images/create/create-interface.png
:name: fig:create-interface

The LX create tool configuration interface.
```

```{todo}
Let's retake figure {numref}`fig:create-interface` with less empty space on the sides of the form to guarantee better 
visibility given the narrow viewport of these docs. Example: [the init sd card form](https://staging-docs.duckietown.com/daffy/opmanual-duckiebot/_images/init-sd-card-gui-01.png).
```


Once you have filled in each of the intial configuration details, click on `Generate LX`.  
You should receive the following message.

```{figure} ../../_images/create/create-success.png
:name: fig:lx-create-success
:width: 50%

The message indicating your new LX development project was successfully generated.
```

```{trouble}

The form does not close or give the success message when I select `Create`. What now?

---
If you have any issues with the form submission, check your command line for any error messages associated with the 
data you provided. Then resubmit the form.
```

Return to the command line to ensure your project was created successfully. 

## Verify your template

When the create process is finished, verify 
that your LX development project structure matches the following

```{figure} ../../_images/create/dev-tree.png
:name: dev-tree-create

Directory structure of the LX development project generated by `dts lx create`.
```

The first step after creating a new development project should always be to run `dts code build` in the 
`<your-lx>-lx` directory to ensure that the template was initialized properly.

## Jumping into to development ...

The next section of this development manual focuses on providing context and tutorials for each type of learning 
experience activity that you can add to your new LX template.  An LX may have one, several, or all activity types 
included, so read through the educational purposes associated with each one to determine what is best for your desired 
learning outcome.
