# Step 2: Develop Your Activities

```{tableofcontents}
```

The following chapters outline the implementation steps and build requirements for each type of activity that a 
learning experience may contain.  Use the **Educational purpose** sections to determine which activity type is right 
for the learning goal you are adding to the LX, then jump right into the list of **Edit zones** for free form 
content development or use walk through the **Tutorial** example.

```{tip}
As you develop LX content, create the solutions in real time, then copy your fully tested and functional work into 
the `<yourlx>-solutions` directory before replacing sections of code with student TODOs.
