# Publishing Your LX

`lx-development` project directories can be published to their respective repositories using the `dts code publish` 
tool.  
This 
provides a streamlined interface for managing repositories and branches so that your LX directories will never be 
out of sync with eachother across the development project.

### What do I need to know ahead of time?

Some information is required to publish your LX:

```{figure} ../../_images/create/publish-repo.png
:name: publish-repo

The repository and branch that each directory will be published to.
```

```{figure} ../../_images/create/publish-default.png
:name: publish-default

The default values will be saved for convenient iterative publishing.
```

```{figure} ../../_images/create/publish-version.png
:name: publish-version

The publish commit message.
```
