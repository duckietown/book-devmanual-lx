# LX Structure

A learning experience is structured in three parts.  These three directories are packaged into a single working 
directory when the `dts lx create` command is used to generale a new, blank LX for development and then split into 
separate repositories for learners to consume.  

If you are reading this as a learner, you will only need to use the 
single LX directory provided for you - all of the necessary behind the scenes components to drive the LX activities 
will be linked in automatically.

### Development Workspace

```{figure} ../../_images/create/dev-tree.png
:name: dev-tree

Directory structure of the LX development project generated by `dts code create`.
```

### LX (the meat)

```{figure} ../../_images/create/lx-template-tree.png
:name: lx-template-tree

Directory structure of the LX template generated by `dts code create`.
```

### Recipe (everything behind the scenes)

```{figure} ../../_images/create/recipe-template-tree.png
:name: recipe-template-tree

Directory structure of the LX recipe template generated by `dts code create`.
```

### Solution

An LX solution directory should always contain the fully developed and tested version of the associated LX directory, 
with example agent and activity solutions. The working code can then be stripped out of the LX directory and 
replaced with student TODOs.
