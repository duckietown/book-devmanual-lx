# Step 1: Create a New LX

New learning experiences are developed within `lx-development` projects.  This provides a working directory 
containing all three of the required directories for your LX in one place.

### What do I need to know ahead of time?

Some information is required to initialize your LX:

* **Title** - this is a human readable name that will also be converted into a safe file format to name your LX 
  directories. For example, `How to Robot!` is used as the title and then converted to `how-to-robot` in file and 
  directory names.
* **Description** - this should contain a learning goal for the LX and short summary of what students will accomplish.
* **Dependencies** - the `dts lx create` interface allows you to list intial `apt` and `python3` dependencies so that 
  you can ensure your base build works prior to development.

```{note}
You can always go back and change these values within the 
appropriate project files later, but beginning your work with a title, learning goal, and list of general 
dependencies will help focus your activity development.
```

### Creating an LX development project

```{figure} ../../_images/create/create-interface.png
:name: create-interface

The LX create tool configuration interface.
```

```{figure} ../../_images/create/create-success.png
:name: create-success

The success message indicating your new LX development project was successfully generated.
```

When finished, verify that your LX development project structure matches the following

```{figure} ../../_images/create/dev-tree.png
:name: dev-tree-create

Directory structure of the LX development project generated by `dts code create`.
```

The first step after creating a new development project should always be to run `dts code build` in the 
`<your-lx>-lx` directory to ensure that the template was initialized properly.
