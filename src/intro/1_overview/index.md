# LX Philosophy

A learning experience is a stand-alone block of activites that is self-contained and ideally can plug and play into a 
full course of materials.

**TODO: Why should I consume an LX?  Why should I create an LX?**

### Outcomes

Outcomes after completing a learning experience should generally be actionable skills to demonstrate their knowledge.  
These skills are verified through the culminating a demo activity that can be run on a simulated or real world Duckiebot 
and evaluated in a challenge.

### Learning Goals

LX developers should answer the following questions in the LX description contained in each README and anyone 
working through an LX should use this information to direct their efforts as they choose and work through LX: 

* What will the LX learner gain from this experience? These are the “outputs” of a LX. For example, learners will be 
  able to develop and tune a PID controller for a differential drive robot, then activate their work on a Duckiebot.
* What is the prerequisite knowledge and where can learners find it?
