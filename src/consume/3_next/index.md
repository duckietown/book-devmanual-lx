# Step 3: What's Next?

Goal: Walk through the steps to build your own demo on top of an existing LX or progress to the next section to create a new one

And that's it!  With a few Duckietown shell commands, you have all the tools you need to learn and develop robotic 
systems that will perform in the simulator or on a real world robot.
