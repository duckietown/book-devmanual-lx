# `dts code build`

## What does it do?

The `dts code build` command builds the learning experience package into a Docker image that will be 
used by each of the other commands in the workflow.

The first step to working through any learning experience is to build it.

```{hint}
Strengthen your iterative development habits by beginning every work session with a fresh build of your LX. 
This will help ensure that you don't continue development on top of any previous errors.
```

## Prerequisites

Always make sure that your system is up-to-date before starting a new learning experience. 
If you haven't yet installed the Duckietown shell and configured your development environment, 
return to the [](env-setup) before continuing.

- Update the shell commands:

      dts update

- Update your laptop/desktop: 

      dts desktop update

- Update your Duckiebot: 

      dts duckiebot update [ROBOT_NAME]


## How do I run it?

First, navigate into the directory containing the **hello-world** learning experience (or the root directory of the LX you are working on completing).

**`duckietown-lx/hello-world-lx`**

```{figure} ../../_images/consume/lx-directory.png
:name: lx-directory

List of LX directories with the hello-world-lx directory highlighted.
```

```{important}
All `dts code` commands should be executed inside the root directory of the learning experience.
```

Then run

    dts code build

You will see the following message once your LX has built successfully,

```{figure} ../../_images/consume/build-success.png
:name: build-success

Success message that indicates a successful LX build.
```

For more information about what is happening during your build process, you can run any `dts code` command in debug 
mode using the `--debug` flag.

    dts --debug code build

## Troubleshooting

If you run into any issues while building the image, you can search the troubleshooting symptoms below or 
reference the [](how-to-get-help) section of this manual.

```{trouble}

`dts :  The path '/home/myuser/not_an_lx_directory' does not appear to be a Duckietown project. 
     :  The metadata file '.dtproject' is missing.`

---
You need to be in the root directory of the LX in order to run the `dts code` commands.
```

## What's Next?

Now that you've built the **hello-world** learning experience, continue on to the next page to 
open the editor and complete your first notebook activities.

## Extra Options

```{warning}
If this is your first time using the `dts code` workflow, don't worry about the following section just yet. 
Continue on to the next page to open you first LX activity.
```

Once you are comfortable with the `dts code` workflow, you may want to use some additional control provided 
over each command. This section documents each of the flags available to extend the `dts code build` command.

You can also explore the [Behind the Scenes - dts code build](behind-the-scenes-code-build) chapter 
for more details on what happens in the background when you run the `dts code build` command.
