# `dts code evaluate`

## What does it do?

The `dts code evaluate` command runs your code to implement a robot agent at the end of each LX and evaluates it 
against some set of performance metrics for the Duckiebot. This might be distance travelled in an obstacle avoidance 
challenge, intersections successful and lawfully handled in the Duckietown city, or any other hurdle that the LX 
creator may have defined for you.  

Details of the evaluation metrics will be outlined in the LX `README` file.

## How do I run it?

We suggest you evaluate your work locally before submitting your solution.
You can do so by running the following command,

    dts code evaluate

This should take a few minutes.

Wait for a URL to appear on the terminal, then click on it or copy-paste it in the address bar
of your browser to access the real-time visualization of your evaluation simulation and statistics.

If you run into any issues using this command, you can search the troubleshooting symptoms below or 
reference the [](how-to-get-help) section of this manual.

## Troubleshooting

```{trouble}

`dts :  The path '/home/myuser/not_an_lx_directory' does not appear to be a Duckietown project. 
     :  The metadata file '.dtproject' is missing.`

---
You need to be in the root directory of the LX in order to run the `dts code` commands.
```

## Extra Options

```{warning}
If this is your first time using the `dts code` workflow, don't worry about the following section just yet. 
Continue on to the next page to submit the soliution to your first LX activity.
```

Once you are comfortable with the `dts code` workflow, you may want to use some additional control provided 
over each command. This section documents each of the flags available to extend the `dts code evaluate` command.

You can also explore the [Behind the Scenes - dts code evaluate](behind-the-scenes-code-evaluate) chapter
for more details on what happens in the background when you run the `dts code evaluate` command.
