# The Learning Experiences Developer Manual

A Duckietown Learning Experience provides a structured template for using the Duckietown infrastructure to create 
and work through high quality learning activities. The goal of this developer manual is provide all of the tools you 
need to first work through an LX and then use the skills you develop to create your own custom Duckiebot demos and 
learning experiences.
